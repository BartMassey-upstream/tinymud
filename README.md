# tinymud

This is source for the famous and ancient `tinymud`, a
textual multi-user dungeon accessed with `telnet` or a
specialized client.

Please see the original [README](./README) and
[documentation](./docs/) for further information.

Minimal changes have been made to this 1990 source to get it
to compile on a Linux box in 2003, and again in 2017.
