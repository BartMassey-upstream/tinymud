How to install TinyTalk.
------------------------

  TinyTalk should run on any BSD 4.2 or 4.3-derived system.  It should
compile without modifications on all of these systems.  To build
TinyTalk, just type 'make' in the tinytalk directory.

  Some systems may not have the termcap library available, or may have
a buggy one.  On these systems, you must edit the Makefile first.
Remove the '-DTERMCAP' and '-ltermcap' from the CFLAGS and LIBRARIES
lines, respectively.

  If all goes well, typing 'make' will leave the executable in the
file 'tinytalk'.  If you have very limited disk space, typing 'strip
tinytalk' afterward will remove the symbol table, freeing up some
space.

  On HP-UX 7.0 systems, edit the Makefile to add -DHPUX to the CFLAGS
line, then build as usual.

  On System V systems, edit the Makefile to add -DSYSVTTY to the
CFLAGS line, then build as usual.  You may also need to remove the
-DTERMCAP line.
