Changes since TinyTalk 1.0.
---------------------------

Version 1.1.2 release 6/25/90.

  * Bug in /logme corrected.

  * Bug in /recall corrected.

Version 1.1.1 release 2/16/90.

  * Support for HP-UX 7.0 and System V integrated.

Version 1.1 final release 2/7/90.

  * Portals are quieter when not in auto-login mode.

  * A failed portal connection causes the connection to be ignored,
    rather than exiting TinyTalk.

  * Added a word-delete character (default ^W).

  * Added a refresh character (default ^R).

  * Added /QUIT, /INTR, and /NOINTR.  These allow ^C to be ignored,
    instead of causing TinyTalk to exit, and provide a new command to
    exit.  The default is to exit on ^C.

  * Added /BEEP and /NOBEEP.  These allow pages to be indicated with
    an audible beep.  The default is to use three beeps.

  * Added /STTY and /NOSTTY.  These allow the system's terminal
    information to be read for keyboard processing, rather than using
    the default characters.  The default is to use the old characters.

  * Added /GAG, /NOGAG, /SAVEGAG, /LOADGAG, and /LISTGAG.  These allow
    the actions of specific characters to be ignored (useful for
    silencing noisy robots).

  * Added /HILITE, /NOHILITE, /LOADHILITE, /SAVEHILITE, and /LISTHILITE.
    These allow specific characters to be hilited; also, whispers and
    pages can be hilited.

  * Added /WHISPER and /NOWHISPER.  /NOWHISPER simulates silent whisper.

  * Added /RECALL, to retrieve the last line typed.

  * Added /LISTWORLDS and /WORLD, for moving between worlds.
