This is a selection of three of the more popular clients for the
tinyMUD program.

	tint - a VMS client
	tinymud.el - a EMACS major mode client
	tinytalk - a Unix/curses client

tint_shar.dcl is a VMS DCL archive file. It should be copied intact
to a VMS host and fed to DCL. The tinytalk subdirectory contains
the Makefile and README files for tinytalk.

tinytalk came from derby.cs.wisc.edu
tinymud.el and tint came from lancelot.avalon.cs.cmu.edu
